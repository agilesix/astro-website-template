We're thrilled to announce a new partnership with the State Department of Health to redesign their online healthcare portal, making it easier for citizens to access vital health services and information.

## What This Means

This partnership will focus on improving the user experience of the state's healthcare portal, with particular attention to:

- Simplifying the application process for health benefits
- Improving accessibility for users with disabilities
- Making information easier to find and understand
- Reducing wait times and processing delays

## Our Approach

Our team will work closely with the Department of Health to conduct extensive user research, redesign key user flows, and implement accessibility improvements. We'll use an agile, iterative approach to deliver improvements quickly while ensuring we meet all compliance requirements.

## Timeline

The project is expected to launch in phases over the next 12 months, with the first improvements going live in Q2 2024.

## Looking Forward

We're excited to help make healthcare services more accessible and user-friendly for all citizens. This partnership represents our continued commitment to improving government services through user-centered design and technology.
