Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. This guide will help you understand the requirements and implement compliant solutions.

## What is Section 508?

Section 508 requires that federal agencies' electronic and information technology be accessible to people with disabilities, including employees and members of the public. This includes:

- Websites and web applications
- Software and operating systems
- Electronic documents
- Video and multimedia content

## Key Requirements

### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

Section 508 aligns with WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards. Key requirements include:

- **Perceivable**: Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive
- **Operable**: Interface components must be operable by all users
- **Understandable**: Information and UI operation must be understandable
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough for assistive technologies

### Common Compliance Areas

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: All functionality must be keyboard accessible
2. **Screen Reader Support**: Content must be readable by screen readers
3. **Color Contrast**: Text must meet minimum contrast ratios
4. **Alt Text**: Images must have descriptive alternative text
5. **Form Labels**: All form inputs must have associated labels

## Testing for Compliance

Regular testing is essential. Use a combination of:

- Automated testing tools (axe, WAVE, Lighthouse)
- Manual testing with keyboard navigation
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- User testing with people with disabilities

## Getting Help

Compliance can be complex. Consider working with accessibility experts who understand both the technical requirements and the user experience needs of people with disabilities.
