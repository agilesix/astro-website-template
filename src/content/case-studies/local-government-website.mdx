## Challenge

The City of Springfield's website was difficult to navigate, had outdated information, and wasn't accessible to residents with disabilities. Residents struggled to find services, pay bills, and access important city information.

## Our Approach

We worked closely with city staff and residents to create a website that truly serves the community:

### Research & Planning
- Conducted resident surveys and interviews
- Analyzed website analytics to understand usage patterns
- Worked with city departments to understand service delivery
- Created a content strategy focused on resident needs

### Design & Development
- Redesigned navigation based on resident mental models
- Created clear service pages with actionable information
- Implemented a content management system for easy updates
- Built full accessibility features
- Optimized for mobile devices

### Content Strategy
- Rewrote content in plain language
- Organized information by resident tasks, not city departments
- Created clear calls-to-action
- Added visual elements to improve comprehension

## Results

The redesigned website achieved significant improvements:

- **70% increase** in online service usage
- **55% reduction** in phone calls to city offices
- **90% user satisfaction** score
- **Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**
- **50% faster** average page load times

## Key Features

- **Service finder**: Easy way to find and access city services
- **Online payments**: Pay bills and fees online
- **Event calendar**: Clear listing of city events
- **Accessibility**: Works with all assistive technologies
- **Mobile-first**: Optimized for smartphone users

## Impact

The redesigned website has transformed how residents interact with city government. More residents can now access services online, reducing wait times and improving satisfaction. The accessible design ensures all residents can use the website independently.
