## Challenge

The Federal Benefits Portal was difficult to navigate, had low completion rates, and wasn't accessible to users with disabilities. Citizens struggled to find and apply for benefits, leading to frustration and reduced access to critical services.

## Our Approach

We conducted extensive user research to understand the real needs of citizens accessing benefits. Our approach included:

### User Research
- 50+ interviews with diverse users
- Usability testing with people with disabilities
- Journey mapping of the entire benefits application process
- Analysis of support tickets and user feedback

### Design Process
- Redesigned information architecture based on user mental models
- Created clear, plain-language content
- Implemented progressive disclosure to reduce cognitive load
- Built in accessibility from the ground up

### Development
- Modern, responsive design
- Full Section 508 compliance
- Support for assistive technologies
- Mobile-first approach

## Results

The redesigned portal achieved significant improvements:

- **40% reduction** in application processing time
- **95% user satisfaction** score (up from 62%)
- **60% increase** in completed applications
- **100% Section 508 compliance**
- **3x faster** page load times

## Key Learnings

1. **Start with user needs**: Understanding real user needs led to better design decisions
2. **Accessibility benefits everyone**: Accessible design improved the experience for all users
3. **Plain language matters**: Clear, simple language reduced confusion and support requests
4. **Iterative improvement**: Regular user testing and feedback loops were essential

## Impact

The redesigned portal has made federal benefits more accessible to millions of citizens, particularly those with disabilities and limited technical skills. The project demonstrates how user-centered design can transform government services.
